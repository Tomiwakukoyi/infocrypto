This is a web app built with React Js to display real time information about cryptocurrencies.
All the information are real time crypto information and news gotten from an API

- IÂ  used Axios to make the API requests
- I de-structured the results from the API and passed them as contacts to finally use them as props before dynamically displaying them
- I used lots of state management in this project to manage this App
- I used Ant design for the styling of this project
- I also used some external libraries like Millify which I used to write the numbers in readable and easy to understand format
