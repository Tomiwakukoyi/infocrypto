A react js web app to display real time cryptocurrency information and cryptocurrency news.
- I used react best practices, tools and libraries
- I used Apis to fetch information about the cryptocurrencies and another Api to fetch crypto currency news.
- I also destructured the Results from the Api information and passed them as constants to use them in the main code as props and then display them.
- I also used states to manage events.
